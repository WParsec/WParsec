## Hello There! 

My name is Tom Erik William Ertvaag.  
Welcome to my hub!
  
I am a 27 year old Norwegian male currently residing on the east coast of Spain while studying. This was not always the case though. Primarily I followed in  my familyâ€™s footsteps and became a sailor. After a few years as an officer, my longing for creativity and increased autonomy got the upperhand of me and I decided to "turn that ship around", so I quit. 

I started looking for creative professions that would also let me challenge and utilize my brain to itâ€™s full potential. From here I discovered Frontend Development, where creativity meets coding. Currently Iâ€™m on the final semester of a 2 year study. I find every aspect of it very stimulating, and I canâ€™t wait to develop my skills even further!  

As many other coders, I have a grand fascination for- , but also a slight fear of AI rendering my skills undesirable in near future. Learning by the term; "If you canâ€™t beat them, join them", I hope to find jobs that embrace this change and perhaps work specifically with it, so that I can surf the coming wave instead of being drowned by it. 
My love for visual creativity and aesthetic designs also makes assignments like portfolios and sites with daring and interactive design of great interest for me. 

## Projects

### Semester Project 2 - Auction Website

This is my semester project for 2nd year at Noroff Front-end Development. We were given the task to create an auction website from start to finish with design and theme of own choice - over the course of 5 weeks. For market relevance, I decided to create an NFT auction website. Beware that other students have access to the same API, so although my site is an NFT site, items on the API are not necessarily NFTÂ´s.

### Cross Course Project 1st Year - Gaming Website using REST API 

Our first project of the 1st year, using HTML, CSS and JS and REST API to Wordpress. 
This is my first ever launched website. Many functions are missing and code is far from professional, but it recieved exceptional feedback at the time.
