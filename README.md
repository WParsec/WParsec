### Semester Project 2 - Auction Website

This is my semester project for 2nd year at Noroff Front-end Development. We were given the task to create an auction website from start to finish with design and theme of own choice - over the course of 5 weeks. For market relevance, I decided to create an NFT auction website. Beware that other students have access to the same API, so although my site is an NFT site, items on the API are not necessarily NFTÂ´s. 

The project recieved great feedback and the grade A.

### Project Exam 2

This project is the final exam for a 2-year Front-end Study at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media. Our task was to design and create a venue booking website. The application consists of two parts: a customer-facing side where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues. The site fulfils the requested user stories provided in our assignment brief, but naturally lacks many functionalities a real site would have. 

The assignment was given an A grade and great feedback.
