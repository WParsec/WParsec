## Hello There! 

My name is Tom Erik William Ertvaag.  
Welcome to my hub!
  
I am a 27 year old Norwegian male currently residing on the east coast of Spain while studying. This was not always the case though. Primarily I followed in my familyâ€™s footsteps and became a sailor. After a few adventurous years as an officer, my longing for creativity and increased autonomy got the upper-hand of me and I decided to "turn that ship around", so I quit.

I started looking for challenging creative professions. From there I discovered Frontend Development, where creativity meets logic. I loved it from the start. Currently Iâ€™m on the final semester of a 2 year study. I find every aspect of it very stimulating, and I canâ€™t wait to develop my skills even further!

### Semester Project 2 - Auction Website

This is my semester project for 2nd year at Noroff Front-end Development. We were given the task to create an auction website from start to finish with design and theme of own choice - over the course of 5 weeks. For market relevance, I decided to create an NFT auction website. Beware that other students have access to the same API, so although my site is an NFT site, items on the API are not necessarily NFTÂ´s. 

The project recieved good feedback and the grade A.
