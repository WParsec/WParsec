## Hello There! 

My name is Tom Erik William Ertvaag. 
Welcome to my hub!
  
I am a 27 year old Norwegian male currently reciding on the east coast of Spain while studying. This was not always the case tho. Primarily I followed in  my familyâ€™s footsteps and became a sailor. After a few years as an officer, my longing for creativity and increased autonomy got the upperhand of me and I decided to "turn that ship around", so I quit. 

I started looking for creative professions that would also let me challenge and utilize my brain to itâ€™s full potential. From here I discovered Frontend Development, where creativity meets coding. Currently Iâ€™m on the final semester of a 2 year study. I find every aspect of it very stimulating, and I canâ€™t wait to develop my skills even further!  

As many other coders, I have a grand fascination for- , but also a slight fear of AI rendering my skills undesirable in near future. Learning by the term; "If you canâ€™t beat them, join them", I hope to find jobs that embrace this change and perhaps work specifically with it, so that I can surf the coming wave instead of being drowned by it. 
My love for visual creativity and aesthetic designs also makes assignments like portfolios and sites with daring design of great interest for me.
