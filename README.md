  Hey, Iâ€™m Tom Ertvaag. Welcome to my hub!
  <br><br>
  I love to create stuff. Whether its painting, music, design or coding, I love to see the pieces fall into place and form aesthetic results. 
  This love has sent me on a journey down the development rabbithole, and I'm currently on my first year of a 2 year Frontend Dev study.
